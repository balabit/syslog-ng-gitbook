## Contribution

In this chapter we would like to introduce you into the contribution
of open-source projects through syslog-ng. To do so we will show you
the tools and ideas our contribution process is built on. Some patterns are
also stated here to provide you an easy way to start collaborating.
After reading this chapter we hope that you will have no dark spots
about how to start.
