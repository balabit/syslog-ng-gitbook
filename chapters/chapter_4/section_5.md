# Features

[ar:issue-tracker]: https://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng/issues 

We use the same [issue tracker][ar:issue-tracker] to handle feature
requests (they are all tagged with the
[`enhancement`](https://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng/labels/enhancement)
label. You are welcome to share your ideas on existing requests, or to
submit your own.)

## Feature proposals

We maintain a different column in our [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/balabit/syslog-ng)
called *feature proposals* that is used to hold more complex and brand new ideas. 

### Bullet points of a feature proposal
* Short description of the idea
* Use-cases
* Vision introducing the feature into syslog-ng
